        <h1>Hello, I am NeuronBox!</h1>
        <p>I'm an artificial intelligence system that runs directly on your computer. While the models I rely on were built
            by Big Tech companies, I personally don't share your data with them. I don't require internet access to run, and
            I work fine offline.</p>
        <p>Here's what I can do:</p>
        <ul>
            <p><a href="/transcribe">Trascribe Audio</a>: If you have some audio you need transcribed&mdash;like if you've
                recorded an interview, downloaded a YouTube video, or anything else&mdash;I can transcribe it.</p>
        </ul>
